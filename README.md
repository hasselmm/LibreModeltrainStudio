Libre Modelrail Studio
======================

A free collection of software tools dealing with digital model railways.

There is plenty of software around digital model railways. This software
is great, and it works. Still many of these projects are isolated efforts
by single companies, or persons. Lack of cooperation prevents that these
projects reach their full potential. This project is meant as invitation
to build better modelrailing software together.

Supported Hardware
------------------

- [Roco Z21](https://www.z21.eu/), and compatible control stations
- [ESU Lokprogrammer](https://www.esu.eu/produkte/lokprogrammer/)
- [KPF-Zeller](https://kpf-zeller.de/) Speed Cat

Building
--------

This software is built using Qt 6.4. So you'll have to install the
[Qt SDK](https://qt.io/) first. Once Qt is installed you can simply
open the toplevel `CMakeLists.txt` in QtCreator.

Alternatively open a commandline, add Qt 6.4 to your `PATH`,
and run [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
