Introduction
============

Libre Railroad Studio, short "LMRS", is collection of free software tools
dealing with various aspects of digital model railways.

There is plenty of software around digital model railways. This software
is great, and it works. Still many of these projects are isolated efforts
by single companies, or persons. Lack of cooperation prevents that these
projects reach their full potential. This project is meant as invitation
to build better modelrailing software together.
